# Deprecated

Dinghy used to be deployed on the `dinghy` name on crates.io, we've since moved to `cargo-dinghy` to have the same name as the binary.

The use of the `dinghy` crate is deprecated, use `cargo-dinghy` instead.

Install it with the following command:

```
$ cargo install cargo-dinghy
```

This crate is just a placeholder to be deployed on crates.io with the `dinghy` name, it fails on compilation to prompt users to install the correct crate.
